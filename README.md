## Opening a sample in Android Studio

To open one of the samples in Android Studio, begin by checking out `master` branches, and then open the root directory in Android Studio.

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:googlesamples/android-architecture.git
```
This step checks out the master branch.

Finally open the `android-architecture/` directory in Android Studio.
